      Over the past week I have read several heartbreaking and discouraging articles about women and gender issues in science. These stories have provoked the deep personal reflection and insightful conversations with friends, the kind that I hope to cultivate here on this blog. As I was thinking about how to address the topic, I read the amazingly personal and poignant first post on my friend Jill's new blog, <a href="https://endlessandunbounded.wordpress.com/">Endless Pain & Unbound Virtues</a>. Inspired by her self reflection, I'm writing this week about math and me.

    <p>"I'm not good at math."</p>

    <p>"I'll never get through medical school."</p>

    <p>"I'll never get through calculus."</p>

    <p>"I'm not smart enough!"</p>

    <p>"I don't understand anything."</p>

    <p>"I can't do it. I can't." This has been my math mantra for so long, and my only mantra over the past three weeks. Three weeks of 9 am Calculus. Three weeks of doing math homework everyday. Three weeks of "I can't."</p>

    <p>If you asked me, I'd say that I've never been good at math. An honest look back on my experiences, however, doesn't tell that story. At the end of second grade, our teacher showed us multiplication. I was intrigued by this new way of doing addition and recall a glimmer of pride when she praised me for my questions about how it worked. As an undergrad, I enrolled in psych stats with more that a little trepidation but found, to my surprise, that I was good at it. "Finally!" I told myself, "useful math!". And science? Which is full of math? I have always loved science, and it's accompanying math has always been high on my list of "I can," even when it was difficult.</p>

    <p>However, it's mostly negative emotions dominating the view when I reflect on my history with math. In the third grade, we officially learned multiplication. Instead of learning with hands on exploration of the concepts, like we had in second grade, we were taught in a way that encouraged rule memorization. I can still feel the sharp sting of shame at being stuck on the x3 worksheets, while the other students moved all the way on up through x12 and were then sent off to the gym to compete in speed rounds. I wanted to go too! And yet, despite trying over and over, I keep failing to get past x3.</p>

    <p>Each day, more and more kids left for the speed rounds, and each day the classroom, and my self-perception, changed. Looking around, I found myself suddenly aware that I was a girl, in a room with the girls. I tried so hard, I really did! I wanted to get it, to understand, to succeed. It hurt to want to succeed and find myself lacking, and I didn't want to hurt. The other girl's didn't seem bothered by being left behind. None of them were upset that they didn't understand the math.</p>

    <p>The snarky voices, the ones that became the math mantra, began. "I am not good enough," "not smart enough," and clearly, I should give up, because I am a girl and, clearly, girls aren't smart enough for math. What a revelation! If I decided that I didn't care, then I wouldn't be hurt by not getting it! Right? Without a clue of how to get better, I adopted the attitude of the group left behind. "We're girls," we said, "we can't do math."</p>

    <p>"I can't do it. I can't"</p>

    <p>It was probably the 200th time I had said it out loud and the millionth time I had thought it. My partner deserves beatification for putting up with it and sainthood for replying each time, "Yes you can. " I did my best to argue the overwhelming evidence in my support, particularly that of the historical record showing my continued incompetence and lack of understanding. "You're spending as much time freaking out saying ‘you can't do it' as you are actually doing the work," said my saint-in-the-making. "Each time we go over something that you are so sure that you don't get, it turns out to be a simple error or an instance where you got 99% of it right and were able to quickly pick up the 1% you had missed. If you take a step back when you get stuck, stop telling yourself that ‘you can't,' and start telling yourself that ‘you can,' you'd get done faster, learn more and be less exhausted."</p>

    <p>I'd like to say that the scientist in me collected this observation, analyzed the data, concluded that they contradict my current theory, and formed a new hypothesis. The reality is that it was frustration-induced exhaustion that got the message through. As I did my take-home test this weekend, I tried out this new approach. I still freaked out. A lot. But I also breathed a lot more and said my new mantra a lot. "I can do this. I can." I think that it's working. I'll let you know how it goes. Oh, and I just calculated my grade so far. I've got an A. Not bad for a girl.</p>
